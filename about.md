I have a Master of Science in Applied Physics from New Jersey Institute of Technology and have turned my attention to the world of Data Science/Analytics. With machine learning algorithms, problems of many disciplines can be investigated and solved.  I am a very curious and inquisitive person with a thirst for research and knowledge.  My background has made me into a tenacious problem solver and creative thinker.  I will be grateful for the opportunity to learn from those who are more experienced than myself.
